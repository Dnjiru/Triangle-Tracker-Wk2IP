# TRIANGLE TRACKER
#### {The Application will take values of Traingle Length, Commutes and give a feedback of whether the Triangle is an Isosceles,Equilateral, Scalene or No Triangle at all!}, {Date of current version: 28th March 2019.}

## Description
{This is a Web base Application that allows users to determine the type of Triangle they dealing with. The user will require to input the lengths of the three sides of the Triangle. A Triangle can have three different configuration as the following.
1.) All three sides lengths are equal. This is called an equilateral triangle.
2.)Two sides of the triangle. This is called an isosceles tiangle.
3.)All the three sides with different lengths. This is called a scalene triangle.
It is important to note, you can have a triangle is one side is larger than the sum of the other two sides.

This application will use Java Script to analyse the input provided by the user and give an output. Being a web app, we shall use a HTML for mark up and CSS for styling. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Behavior Driven Development(BDD)
{Before writing this code, I focused first on the behaviours that I would want to see in our final application. I considered what the program should do, thought through possible scenarios when the user would encounter when interacting with the application. I considered how the application will handle input of other characters instead of numbers (intergers) or no value at all. 

Therefore, I developed an application that will take three values as lengths of a triangle and give a response to the user what type of the triangle do the values makes. If the values can not make a triangle, the application gives a response; that is not a triangle. }
## Known Bugs
{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know? Outline any issues that would impact use of your application. Share any workarounds that are in place. }
## Technologies Used
{I have used HTML for mark up, CSS for Styling and Java Script to code the function of comparing the values inputted and outputing results as per the description.}
## Support and contact details
{It is unlikely that you run into any issues as you use the application. But incase you do, please drop me an email at mr.mwaniki@gmail.com.

You are also welcome to contribute to the code that is available on GitHub.

Please reach out for collaboration, consultation or just "Hi, Let's have Coffee."}
